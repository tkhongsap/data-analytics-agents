```

## Directory and File Management

### Review Artifacts Location
- **Primary Location**: `/reviews/[target-name]/`
- **Plan File**: `review-plan-[target-name].md`
- **Ensure Directory**: Create `/reviews/` if it doesn't exist

### File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `review-plan-auth-module.md`
- Include date for multiple reviews: `review-plan-api-2024-01-15.md`
- Target name should be descriptive but concise

### Artifact Organization
```
/reviews/[target-name]/
├── review-plan-[target-name].md          # This phase output
├── review-tasks-[target-name].md         # Phase 2 output
├── review-report-[target-name].md        # Phase 3 output
├── executive-summary-[target-name].md    # Phase 4 output
├── implementation-guide-[target-name].md # Phase 4 output
└── artifacts/                            # Supporting files
```

## Quality Assurance

### Plan Validation Checklist
- [ ] Clear, measurable objectives defined
- [ ] Scope is appropriate and achievable
- [ ] Timeline is realistic given scope
- [ ] Success criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements addressed
- [ ] Risk factors identified and mitigated

### Scope Appropriateness
- **Too Broad**: Reduce scope to manageable components
- **Too Narrow**: Ensure critical paths are covered
- **Just Right**: Focused but comprehensive coverage

### Objective Clarity
- Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Link objectives to business value
- Ensure outcomes are actionable

## Next Steps

After plan approval:
1. **Proceed to Phase 2**: Task generation using review-task-generator agent
2. **Validate Resources**: Confirm team availability and tool access
3. **Set Up Environment**: Prepare analysis tools and access permissions
4. **Schedule Checkpoints**: Plan progress reviews and stakeholder updates

## Quality Standards

Maintain high standards throughout planning:
- **Thoroughness**: Cover all critical aspects within scope
- **Clarity**: Ensure plan is understandable by all stakeholders  
- **Actionability**: Create plans that lead to concrete outcomes
- **Efficiency**: Balance comprehensiveness with practical constraints
- **Measurability**: Define success criteria that can be objectively assessed

Remember: A well-planned review is half completed. Take time to ensure the plan is comprehensive, realistic, and aligned with stakeholder expectations before proceeding to task generation.
