# Windows Security Event Log Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

This analysis examined **1,429 Windows security events** from clustered CSV files, identifying **442 high-risk events** (z-score > 20) that deviate significantly from normal behavioral patterns. The analysis focused on translating technical security logs into human-readable descriptions for non-technical stakeholders.

## Key Findings

### 1. Most Critical Threats Identified

**Top Critical Event (Z-Score: 75.86):**
- **Event**: Anonymous logon to STBVADC04 from IP 10.7.56.170
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL
- **Explanation**: Anonymous logons from external sources are extremely suspicious and could indicate unauthorized access attempts or system compromise.

**Computer Account Anomalies (Z-Scores 50+):**
- Multiple computer accounts (STBVADC01$) showing extreme privilege escalations and process creations
- These system accounts normally operate quietly in the background - their high activity suggests potential compromise

### 2. Event Types Analysis

The analysis examined the following Windows Event IDs:

#### Event ID 4624 - Successful Account Logon
- **What it means**: Someone successfully logged into a system
- **Normal behavior**: Users logging in during business hours from known locations
- **Suspicious indicators**: 
  - Logons from unusual IP addresses
  - Service accounts logging in from user workstations
  - Multiple simultaneous logons from different locations

#### Event ID 4634 - Account Logoff  
- **What it means**: Someone logged out of a system
- **Normal behavior**: Regular logoffs at end of work sessions
- **Suspicious indicators**: Logoffs without corresponding logons, unusual timing patterns

#### Event ID 4688 - New Process Created
- **What it means**: A new program or service was started
- **Normal behavior**: Standard applications starting during normal use
- **Suspicious indicators**: Unusual programs, suspicious command lines, high-frequency process creation

#### Event ID 4689 - Process Terminated
- **What it means**: A program or service was stopped
- **Normal behavior**: Normal program closure during system operations
- **Suspicious indicators**: Security tools being killed, critical processes terminated unexpectedly

#### Event ID 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned
- **What it means**: Someone was given administrative rights
- **Normal behavior**: Authorized privilege assignments to admin accounts
- **Suspicious indicators**: Regular users getting admin rights, privilege assignment outside normal hours

### 3. Account Type Patterns

#### Computer Accounts (Username ending with $)
- **Purpose**: Automated service-to-service communication
- **Normal behavior**: Quiet background authentication
- **Suspicious findings**: High-frequency interactive logons, unusual IP sources
- **Example**: TBQPF45YEK2$ showed repeated high-risk authentication patterns

#### User Accounts  
- **Purpose**: Human user authentication and system access
- **Normal behavior**: Business hours logons from known locations
- **Suspicious findings**: Multiple location logons, off-hours access

#### Service Accounts (LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE)
- **Purpose**: System service operations
- **Normal behavior**: Automated system tasks
- **Suspicious findings**: Process terminations with extremely high z-scores

#### Anonymous Logon
- **Purpose**: Limited system access for specific services
- **Risk Assessment**: CRITICAL - Anonymous access from external IPs is extremely suspicious

### 4. Cluster Risk Categories

The analysis identified several risk clusters:

#### Critical Risk Clusters
- **Critical_User_Breach**: High-confidence account compromise indicators
- **Critical_Persistent_Threats**: Evidence of advanced persistent threat activity
- **Outlier_Extreme_Risk**: Statistical outliers requiring immediate attention

#### High Risk Clusters  
- **Suspicious_Authentication_Pattern**: Unusual login behaviors
- **Lateral_Movement_Indicators**: Activities suggesting system-to-system movement
- **High_Risk_Authentication**: Authentication with multiple risk factors

#### Medium Risk Clusters
- **Session_Management_Issues**: Unusual session characteristics
- **Suspicious_User_Behavior**: Deviating but possibly benign activities
- **System_Process_Anomalies**: Unusual system process behavior

### 5. Geographic and Network Analysis

**Internal Network Activity (10.x.x.x IPs):**
- Most activity from internal network ranges (10.7.x.x, 10.8.x.x)
- Some suspicious patterns from specific internal subnets

**Localhost Activity (127.0.0.1):**
- Local system authentication - normal for service accounts
- Concerning when combined with unusual process activity

**External Access Patterns:**
- Anonymous logons from IP ranges requiring investigation
- Potential indicator of external threat actor activity

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Z-Score Interpretation
- **0-10**: Normal baseline behavior (Low risk)
- **10-20**: Some deviation warranting monitoring (Medium risk)  
- **20-30**: Significant deviation requiring investigation (Medium-High risk)
- **30-50**: Extreme deviation indicating potential threats (High risk)
- **50+**: Never-before-seen behavior requiring immediate response (Critical risk)

### Investigation Priorities

#### Immediate Action Required (Z-Score > 50)
1. Anonymous logon from 10.7.56.170 (Z-Score: 75.86)
2. Computer account privilege escalations (Z-Scores: 50+)
3. Unusual process creation patterns

#### High Priority Investigation (Z-Score 30-50)  
1. Lateral movement indicators
2. Suspicious authentication patterns
3. Critical persistent threats

#### Medium Priority Monitoring (Z-Score 20-30)
1. Session management anomalies
2. System process irregularities
3. Baseline behavior deviations

## MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping

The analysis identified activities potentially associated with:

- **T1078**: Valid Accounts (credential abuse)
- **T1110**: Brute Force attacks
- **T1021**: Remote Services (lateral movement)
- **T1059**: Command and Scripting Interpreter
- **T1055**: Process Injection
- **T1562**: Impair Defenses
- **T1068**: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate Anonymous Logons**: Review all anonymous access from external IPs
2. **Computer Account Review**: Examine why system accounts show unusual interactive behavior
3. **Privilege Escalation Analysis**: Investigate unexpected admin privilege assignments

### Medium-term Actions  
1. **Baseline Refinement**: Update behavioral baselines based on legitimate business activity
2. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Implement additional monitoring for identified high-risk patterns  
3. **User Education**: Train staff on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Zero Trust Implementation**: Reduce reliance on network-based trust
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Improve event log collection and analysis capabilities
3. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Incorporate external threat feeds into analysis

The analysis used a custom Python interpreter that:
- Processes Windows Event Logs in CSV format
- Applies statistical analysis (z-scores) to identify anomalies
- Provides human-readable explanations for technical events
- Maps activities to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Generates actionable investigation priorities
