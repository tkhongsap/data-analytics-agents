## Risk Categorization Thresholds

Based on statistical analysis of the z-score distributions:

### Computer Accounts Risk Levels
- **Minimal Risk:** 0 - 9.64 (25th percentile)
- **Low Risk:** 9.64 - 21.84 (25th-75th percentile) 
- **Medium Risk:** 21.84 - 27.32 (75th-90th percentile)
- **High Risk:** 27.32 - 29.08 (90th-95th percentile)
- **Critical Risk:** 29.08 - 32.59 (95th-99th percentile)
- **Extreme Risk:** > 32.59 (99th+ percentile)

### User Accounts Risk Levels
- **Minimal Risk:** 0 - 4.09 (25th percentile)
- **Low Risk:** 4.09 - 16.89 (25th-75th percentile)
- **Medium Risk:** 16.89 - 19.85 (75th-90th percentile) 
- **High Risk:** 19.85 - 21.62 (90th-95th percentile)
- **Critical Risk:** 21.62 - 56.09 (95th-99th percentile)
- **Extreme Risk:** > 56.09 (99th+ percentile)

## Why These Events Are Statistically Abnormal

### Understanding Z-Scores in Security Context

**Z-scores represent how many standard deviations an event is from normal behavior.** In a typical environment:
- Z-score of 3: Event has 0.27% probability (unusual but possible)
- Z-score of 5: Event has 0.000057% probability (very rare)
- Z-score of 20: Event has < 1 in 10^10 probability (essentially impossible under normal circumstances)

### Statistical Context of Findings

1. **All Events Are Outliers:** The fact that 100% of events have z-scores > 3 indicates this environment is experiencing sustained abnormal activity patterns.

2. **Extreme Anomalies (z > 20):** These 442 events have probabilities so low they would be expected to occur less than once in the entire history of the universe under normal statistical models.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** Computer accounts showing higher average risk scores (16.58 vs 10.81) suggests automated or system-level threats may be more prevalent.

## Pattern Analysis

### Temporal Patterns
- **Time Concentration:** All events occurred within 3.5 days, suggesting a focused incident or attack campaign
- **Peak Activity:** Analysis shows concentrated activity during specific hours (detailed hourly breakdown available in JSON output)

### Cluster Analysis
Events are grouped into risk clusters:
- **Cluster 0:** High Risk Authentication patterns
- **Cluster 1:** Suspicious Authentication patterns  
- **Cluster 2:** System Process Anomalies
- **Cluster 3:** Lateral Movement Indicators
- **Cluster 4:** Baseline Activity (still anomalous)
- **Cluster 5:** Outlier Extreme Risk events

### Correlation Insights
Multiple z-score metrics show relationships, indicating:
- **Process anomalies correlate with authentication failures**
- **Host increment anomalies align with network access patterns**
- **Combined metrics suggest coordinated attack behaviors**

## Risk Assessment & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Critical Priority:** Investigate all 442 extreme anomalies (z > 20) immediately
2. **High Priority:** Review cluster patterns for coordinated attack signatures
3. **Medium Priority:** Implement enhanced monitoring for computer account activities

### Statistical Thresholds for Alerting

Based on this analysis, recommend implementing alerts at:
- **Z-score > 5:** Automated investigation trigger
- **Z-score > 10:** Human analyst review required  
- **Z-score > 20:** Immediate incident response activation

### Long-term Monitoring

The statistical baselines established in this analysis can be used to:
- Set dynamic thresholds for anomaly detection
- Track improvement in security posture over time
- Identify emerging threat patterns through statistical drift

## Methodology Notes

This analysis used robust statistical methods including:
- Percentile-based risk categorization
- Normal distribution tail probability calculations
- Multi-variate z-score analysis across 5 security metrics
- Temporal and cluster pattern recognition

**Statistical Confidence:** High - Analysis based on 1,429 total events with comprehensive coverage of security event types.
