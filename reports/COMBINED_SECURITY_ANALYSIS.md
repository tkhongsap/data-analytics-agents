## Critical Findings: Coordinated Attack Analysis

### 1. Multi-Stage Attack Progression

The attack shows clear progression across three distinct phases:

| Phase | Timeline | System Activity | User Activity | Objective |
|-------|----------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| **1. Initial Breach** | Aug 25 | 1,195 events, mass compromise | Minimal (2) | Infrastructure control |
| **2. Persistence** | Aug 26 | 119 events, backdoor creation | Baseline (30) | Maintain access |
| **3. Exploitation** | Aug 27 | 57 events, maintenance | Critical (26) | Data access/exfil |

### 2. Attack Correlation Evidence

**System â†’ User Progression:**
- System accounts compromised FIRST (Aug 25)
- User accounts breached AFTER infrastructure control (Aug 27)
- Same hosts targeted in both campaigns
- Escalating severity pattern (system average Z=16.58 â†’ user peak Z=75.86)

**Shared Infrastructure Attacks:**
All 7 domain controllers affected with overlapping compromise:

| Host | System Events | User Events | Combined Risk |
|------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| STBVDRADC01 | 1,149 | 7 | EXTREME |
| STBVADC01 | 80 | 5 | CRITICAL |
| STBVADC02 | 25 | 9 | HIGH |
| STBVADC04 | 31 | 9 | EXTREME |
| STBVADC05 | 18 | 10 | HIGH |
| STBVADC06 | 63 | 11 | MEDIUM |
| STBVADC03 | 5 | 7 | MEDIUM |

### 3. Combined Threat Actor Analysis

| Account Type | Top Threat | Events | Max Z-Score | Impact |
|--------------|------------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **System** | TBQPF45YEK2$ | 1,106 | 32.17 | Infrastructure compromise |
| **User** | ANONYMOUS LOGON | 1 | **75.86** | Complete bypass |
| **Service** | LOCAL SERVICE | 2 | 41.18 | Privilege escalation |

**Critical Observation:** While system accounts show volume, user accounts show severity.

## Immediate Response Plan

### Phase 1: Containment (0-2 hours)

**System Account Actions:**
1. Disable TBQPF45YEK2$ (1,106 malicious events)
2. Isolate STBVDRADC01 (4,462 vulnerability score)
3. Terminate all Z>40 system accounts

**User Account Actions:**
1. Kill ANONYMOUS LOGON sessions
2. Reset LOCAL SERVICE credentials
3. Block IP 10.6.3.198

**Infrastructure Actions:**
1. Network isolation of all DCs
2. Enable break-glass procedures
3. Activate incident response team

### Phase 2: Investigation (2-8 hours)

1. **Forensic Priority Order:**
   - STBVADC04 (ANONYMOUS LOGON host)
   - STBVDRADC01 (primary compromise)
   - All hosts with Z>40 events

2. **Log Collection:**
   - Windows Event Logs (all)
   - PowerShell transcripts
   - Network flows
   - Authentication logs

3. **Threat Hunt:**
   - Search for additional ANONYMOUS attempts
   - Identify persistence mechanisms
   - Map lateral movement paths

### Phase 3: Eradication (8-24 hours)

1. **System Cleaning:**
   - Rebuild compromised DCs
   - Reset all service accounts
   - Remove identified backdoors

2. **Identity Reset:**
